# 3D-Graphics-Projects

Hey there! Welcome to my computer graphics repository, which showcases the various computer graphics projects that I have worked on through this past Fall 2020.

## Projects

Each folder contains their own individual project, implemented in Java. Each one demonstrates a multitude of different techniques and concepts that I have learned within the field of computer graphics.

## Dependencies

Each project was written on the Eclipse IDE, and makes heavy use of Java's OpenGL library to varying extents, from rendering simple primitive 3D shapes such as cylinders and spheres to displaying the projects in their entirety with image buffers.

## Triangle-Rasterization

This project showcases an implementation of Bresenham's algorithm to display 2D line drawing and triangle rasterization. The option for smooth color filling has also been implemented. Using bilinear interpolation techniques for determining colors of pixels between two specified points, the color of all lines/triangles drawn after enabling smooth filling will be filled and blended according to the colors of the vertices.
