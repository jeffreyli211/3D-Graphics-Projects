## Lab 09

In this lab, you are required to use geometry representation you learned in lecture to draw a 3D sphere on 2D canvas. Here are some instructions you might need to finish this lab:
1. Our sphere points are 3D points, they will be stored in Mesh3D.java's 2D array whose size equal to stacks x slices.
2. We then use Mesh3D to get triangle facets of our sphere. Then we decide if we should draw it out by check this facet normal with camera viewing direction.
3. Apply orthogonal projection to our triangle facets to map them to 2D canvas.
4. Call draw triangle function we implemented in PA1 to draw them out on our Canvas.
