/**
 * Name: Jeffrey Li
 * Class: CS 480
 * Programming assignment 2
 * Due date: October 13, 2020
 * Assignment objective: Develop a program that allows the user to control a simulated insect, scorpion, or spider.
 * Requirements:
 * 		1. Use OpenGL to construct a 3D insect, spider, or scorpion model from cylinders and/or ellipsoids.
 * 		2. Write code that enables the user to change the angles at each joint in the creature's body model
 * 		   via the keyboard interface that you define. Limit the angles at each joint within reasonable
 * 		   ranges so that creature's legs, neck, head and any other parts don't intersect or bend in unnatural
 * 		   ways! The orientation of joint rotations for the left and right limbs should mirror each other.
 * 		3. Create 5 (five) different poses of the creature that you defined. Add a keyboard input 'T' to cycle
 * 		   through the poses. 
 * 
 * Notes: This package contains the modified skeleton code of @author Jeffrey Finkelstein's 3D hand model simulation
 * in order to create a 3D spider model, capable of spider-like joint rotations and poses.
